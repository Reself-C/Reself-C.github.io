## Introduction

国际计算机视觉与模式识别会议（CVPR）是IEEE一年一度的学术性会议，会议的主要内容是计算机视觉与模式识别技术。CVPR是世界顶级的计算机视觉会议（三大顶会之一，另外两个是ICCV和ECCV）。今年在6月19日-24日，地点位于新奥尔良。笔者身为IEEE student member报名前去现场参会。

        - future frames
        - interpolation
      - tips: training with different types of mask / use time position encodings to encode times
      - backbone: 3D Conv. / 2D Conv. + Att. (ignore initially when train)
      - long-term: generate a frame far away and then interpolation
    - medical imaging\
        reconstract original image from sparse measurements\
        high-level idea: learn pretrained on pure dataset momdel as "prior" than guide synthesis conditioned on sparse obvervations

        through point clouds
- future trend
    - why diffusion models perform better?
    - how can we improve VAE / flow from diffusion model?

### Evaluating Models Beyond the Textbook: Out-of-distribution and Without Labels [link](https://sites.google.com/view/evalmodel)

- robustness encompasses a broad range of phenomena (adv. examples, corruptions, nat. dist shift, etc.)
- some forms of robustness are currently orthogonal
- consistent trends across natural distribution shifts -> need more fine-grained understanding of different robustness notions.
- training data plays a key role in creating broadly robust models (e.g., CLIP). -> How do we construct training sets that enable broadly reliable models?
- very large improvements in OOD robustness
